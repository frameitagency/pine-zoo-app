                    <h3>OUTSIDE RESTURANT</h3>
                    <p>
                        OUTSIDE RESTAURANT is more than just a place to eat—it's an experience crafted under the open
                        sky. Nestled in a vibrant and welcoming outdoor setting, we combine fresh air, flavorful dishes,
                        and great company to create unforgettable moments. Whether you're joining us for a casual
                        brunch, a sunset dinner, or a celebration with loved ones, OUTSIDE offers the perfect blend of
                        nature and nourishment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our menu is inspired by global street food favorites, locally sourced ingredients, and a passion
                        for seasonal freshness. Every plate tells a story—from wood-fired pizzas and smoky grilled meats
                        to vegan delights and handcrafted beverages. At OUTSIDE, we believe in food that excites the
                        palate while nourishing the soul, served in a laid-back atmosphere that encourages connection
                        and joy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Founded with a love for community and open-air dining, OUTSIDE RESTAURANT is committed to
                        sustainability, inclusivity, and excellent service. Whether you're seated under twinkling string
                        lights or catching some sun in the garden, you’ll always feel at home here. Come hungry, leave
                        happy—and always enjoy the view.
